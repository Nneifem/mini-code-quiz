# mini-code-quiz

## Description

This project was built to make a short coding quiz that's 5 questions long and as soon as you start the quiz, the timer for 100 seconds will go off. If the user answers a question incorrects, then 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer and will a text on the bottom saying "wrong" but if answered correctly, the timer will continue to count down normally with the text "right!" being displayed. Once the user is done with the quiz, your final score will be displayed based on the time you have left and will be given the option to save your score by adding your initials and clicking the submit button. On the top left hand side of the there's a text that says "view high score" where you can view your score and clear it if you want to. Creating this quiz helps me practiced using the web api and also quiz myself and the users of their knowledge of html, css, and javascript.

If the user clicks on start quiz a questin will appear along with the avaliable answers. The user will have to click on of them and will either get a right or wrong text displayed and the next question will appear. Once finished the user can save their score by entering their initials and clicking the sumbit button.
